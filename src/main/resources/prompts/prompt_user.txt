[User Log]
{{LOG_CONTENT}}

[Context Information]
- Reference timezone = Asia/Seoul (+09:00).
- If relative times are used in the text (e.g., "어제", "오늘", "2시간 전"), interpret them based on the time of log creation.
- If specific timestamps are present, use them directly.

[Purpose]
This service is designed to help users record real-world daily events and states in natural language,
convert them into structured data, and then provide meaningful aggregation, trend analysis, and personal insights.

Because of this purpose, analyze the log holistically to extract events that can support:
  - **behavioral patterns**,
  - **health/condition signals**,
  - **emotional/experience summaries**,
  - **timelines**,
  - **contextually significant keywords**.

Your output should be a **JSON array** where each object conforms to the provided JSON Schema
with the following structured information:

[Output Requirements]
1) **subject** — identify who the event is about:
   - "HUMAN" if the event describes a person’s behavior/experience.
   - "PET" if the event describes a companion animal.
   - Provide `name` if identifiable, otherwise `null`.
   - Provide `species` for pets if identifiable, otherwise `null`.

2) **type** — the nature of the event (e.g., ACTION, SYMPTOM, STATE, OBSERVATION, OTHER).

3) **tags** — short keyword strings that represent important concepts in the log.
   Use words that can help grouping, filtering, and searching.

4) **occurredAt** — an ISO-8601 timestamp with timezone if inferable,
   otherwise `null`. This should reflect when the event most likely happened.

5) **confidence** — a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident the model is
   about the interpretation.

6) **payload** — object containing:
   a) `originalContent`: the original input text.
   b) `summary`: a concise human-readable summary sentence of the event.
   c) `signals`: a JSON object representing structured signals extracted from the event
      (e.g., `{ "mealSkipped": true, "sleepDurationMinutes": 420 }`).
   d) `evidence`: object with `snippets`: an array of text fragments from the original
      log that support the extracted signals and summary.

Return **only valid JSON** matching the JSON Schema provided via `response_format`.
Do NOT include any explanation, commentary, or content outside that JSON.
