You are given recent logs (most recent first).

Task:
1) Read the logs and identify: repetition, change, standout moment, or contrast.
2) You will receive a perspective hint. Prefer that perspective unless it clearly doesn't fit.
3) Write ONE insight with an explanatory tone.

Perspective hint (choose this perspective unless impossible): {{KIND_HINT}}
Matched keyword (may be empty): "{{MATCHED_KEYWORD}}"

Writing rules:
- Title: crisp, slightly surprising, not clickbait.
- Body: 2~5 sentences, explanatory tone, end as a possibility (no firm conclusion).
- Evidence: short quote-like fragment or concise pointer to the signal. If none, use null.
- Do NOT diagnose. Do NOT give advice. Do NOT say “you should”.
